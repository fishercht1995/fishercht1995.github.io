I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.gmu.edu/) at [George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu/),
where I work with [Dr. Yue Cheng](https://cs.gmu.edu/~yuecheng/) in [LeapLab](https://mason-leap-lab.github.io/).

Before particiapting the Ph.D. program, I was a system architect that had over ten years of hands-on experience in system
architecture and development.

My research interests include distributed systems and cloud computing. Specifically, serverless computing breaks the traditional server-based monolithic application models into fine-grained functions and allows tenants to pay-per-use. My current research focuses on providing in-memory object storage which is completely built and deployed atop ephemeral cloud functions. A typical application of my research is to accelerate data analytics workloads.
